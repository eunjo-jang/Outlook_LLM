# ITER Outlook Email RAG System Evaluation Results

## Evaluation Overview
This evaluation analyzes the performance of a RAG system based on actual ITER project email data.
- **Expected Answer**: Answers extracted from actual email data (close to ground truth)
- **With RAG**: Answers using the RAG system
- **Without RAG**: Answers from general GPT-4o

---

## Summary of Results

### Conceptual Questions (1-10)
**With RAG**: Partially reflected actual email data but mostly provided generic explanations.
**Without RAG**: Provided more specific and professional information.

### Specific Information Retrieval Questions (11-15)
**With RAG**: Failed to find accurate information in most questions or provided incorrect information.
**Without RAG**: Not applicable (these questions don't exist for general GPT-4o).

## Overall Assessment

**Conceptual Questions (1-10):**
- **With RAG**: Partially reflected actual email data but mostly provided generic explanations.
- **Without RAG**: Provided more specific and professional information.

**Specific Information Retrieval Questions (11-15):**
- **With RAG**: Failed to find accurate information in most questions or provided incorrect information.
- **Without RAG**: Not applicable.

**Conclusion**: The current RAG system underperforms compared to general GPT-4o and shows poor performance in specific information retrieval. Improvements in vector search accuracy and prompt engineering are needed.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Vector Search Accuracy**: Failed to find relevant documents for specific information retrieval
2. **Prompt Engineering**: RAG system didn't sufficiently utilize email data details
3. **Chunking Strategy**: Important email information may not have been properly chunked

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Improve Vector Search**: Use more accurate embedding models or adjust search parameters
2. **Enhance Chunking Strategy**: Better preserve email metadata (date, sender, subject) in chunking
3. **Optimize Prompts**: Improve prompts so RAG system better utilizes specific email data information

The current RAG system requires significant improvement, especially in specific information retrieval tasks.
